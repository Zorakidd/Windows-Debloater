# 🧹 Windows Debloater (PowerShell)

A simple PowerShell script to remove unnecessary preinstalled Windows apps and bloatware.  
Ideal for users who want to clean up and speed up their system. ⚡
There are three versions:

- The first keeps some daily apps I use, like Notepad, Photos, and a media player for audio and video (technically, you could use Photos).
- The second is for Minecraft due to the Xbox API in it.
- The last is an all-uninstall version; it deletes everything except the Microsoft Store because of some system component dependencies.

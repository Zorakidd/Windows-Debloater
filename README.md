# 🧹 Windows Debloater (PowerShell)

A simple PowerShell script to remove unnecessary preinstalled Windows apps and bloatware.  
Ideal for users who want to clean up and speed up their system. ⚡
There are three versions.
The first is left with some daily apps I use like Notepad and Photos and A media player for Audio and Video (technecally you could use Photos)
The second is for Minecraft due to XBOX API in it.
And the last is an all uninstall version, It will delete everythin exept the MicroSoft Store, because of some system componente dependancy
